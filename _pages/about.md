Description
======

<div style="text-align: justify">The rapid advance of AI technologies, e.g., Generative AI and Foundation Models, opens the doors to the exploration and proposal of novel AI solutions in key scenarios of society. These novel solutions can enhance not only the performance but also other critical aspects of the current AI technology such as the explainability, bias, and privacy, following the recent European AI Act guidelines. <b>Cátedra ENIA UAM-VERIDAS en IA Responsable focuses on the following main objectives:</b> i) proposal of novel methods to <b>detect and mitigate the extraction/use of sensitive information</b> in AI models, ii) proposal of novel methods to <b>reduce the bias</b> in AI models, iii) proposal of novel methods to <b>improve the explainability</b> of the AI models, and iv) proposal of novel methods to <b>increase the robustness and security performance</b> of AI systems against attacks such as DeepFakes, poisoning and backdoor attacks, etc.</div>
